Species distribution are largely available in online databases, such as the distributions ranges in IUCN, or occurrence records in GBIF. However, to analyze this kind of data most of the time it is necessary to transform the spatial distribution of species into a presence absence matrix or into a grid format. In this tutorial I will show how to easily make this transformation using the R package [`letsR`](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12401/abstract), wrote by myself and [Fabricio Villalobos](http://fabro.github.io).

## IUCN shapefiles

First you will have to download the species distribution shapefiles from the IUCN [website](http://www.iucnredlist.org/technical-documents/spatial-data). This data can be loaded using the functions `rgdal::readOGR` or `raster::shapefile`. Here I will use the data for the frogs of the family Phyllomedusa, that is already loaded with the letsR package. 
```{r, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(letsR)
data("Phyllomedusa")
```

We can plot the data to see how it looks like.
```{r}
# Plot
## Color settings and assignment
colors <- rainbow(length(unique(Phyllomedusa@data$binomial)), alpha = 0.5)
position <- match(Phyllomedusa@data$binomial, unique(Phyllomedusa@data$binomial))
colors <- colors[position]
## Plot call
plot(Phyllomedusa, col = colors, lty = 0, main = "Spatial polygons of tailles amphibians")
```

### Quick start
Next step we can use the function `lets.presab` to convert species' ranges (in shapefile format) into a presence-absence matrix based on a user-defined grid system. A simple way to do this is to define the extent and resolution of the grid.

```{r}
PAM <- lets.presab(Phyllomedusa, xmn = -93, xmx = -29,
                   ymn = -57, ymx = 15, res = 1)
```

Note that if you have shapefiles with more species, or if you decide for a high resolution grid, the function may run very slowly. In this case, you may want to keep track of the analysis relative running time by setting the argument `count = TRUE`.\n
The PAM results in a `PresenceAbsence` object. This object is basically a list containing a presence absence matrix, a raster with the geographical information, and the species names (for more information `?PresenceAbsence`). We can use the function `summary` to have some summary data on the PAM we just created. 
```{r}
summary(PAM)
```

You can also use the `plot` function directly to the PAM object.
```{r}
plot(PAM)
```

The `plot` function also allow users to plot specific species distributions.
For example we can plot the map of *Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis* 
```{r}
plot(PAM, name = "Phyllomedusa hypochondrialis")
```

As I said before, the PAM object contains the actual presence absence matrix, to access it we can use the following code.
```{r}
presab <- PAM$P
```

The first two columns of the matrix contain the longitude (x) and latitude (y) of the cells' centroid, the following columns include the species' presence(1) and absence(0) information.
```{r}
# Print only the first 5 rows and 3 columns
presab[1:5, 1:3]
```
