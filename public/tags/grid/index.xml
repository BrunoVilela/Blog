      <description>Retrieving plant species distributions from R has recently become quite easy using the BIEN R package, which facilitates the access to the Botanical Information and Ecology Network database. In addition to plant distributions, BIEN allow users to also obtain traits and phylogenetic plant data, making it a resourceful tool for macroecologists. Here I will show how to integrate BIEN and letsR to map phylogenetic diversity, using as an example the Pinus species of North America.</description>

      <description>Most of letsR package functions require a PresenceAbsence object (see previous post). But some users may already have a matrix of species presence absence (PAM) generated somewhere else or created using the lets.presab.grid function. In this post I will show how to transform these PAM files into a PresenceAbsence object.
First, note that this will only be possible if your grid used to generate the PAM is a square or a rectangular grid.</description>

      <description>Species distribution are largely available in online databases, such as the distributions ranges in IUCN, or the occurrence records in GBIF. However, to analyze these kind of data most of the time it is necessary to transform the spatial distribution of species into a presence absence matrix or into a grid format. In this tutorial I will show how to easily make this transformation using the R package letsR, written by myself and Fabricio Villalobos.</description>
