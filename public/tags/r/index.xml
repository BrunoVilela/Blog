      <description>Once you have transformed species distribution data into a presence absence matrix (PAM) in PresenceAbsence format (see the first and second posts on how to do it), you may want to add variables to it. These variables are normally in raster format, for example the WorldClim bioclimatic data, or in shapefile format, for example ecorregions of the world.
Adding variables in raster format To add variables in raster format to a PresenceAbsence object we can use the function lets.</description>

      <description>In previous posts I showed how to build a presence absence matrix (PAM) from species distribution data (check here) as PresenceAbsence object (check also how to transform a PAM into a PresenceAbsence). In this post I will show how to subset or crop a PresenceAbsence object.
Subseting a PresenceAbsence object can be done using the function lets.subsetPAM. You just need to provide the species you want to keep, and the PresenceAbsence object.</description>

      <description>Most of letsR package functions require a PresenceAbsence object (see previous post). But some users may already have a matrix of species presence absence (PAM) generated somewhere else or created using the lets.presab.grid function. In this post I will show how to transform these PAM files into a PresenceAbsence object.
First, note that this will only be possible if your grid used to generate the PAM is a square or a rectangular grid.</description>

      <description>Species distribution are largely available in online databases, such as the distributions ranges in IUCN, or the occurrence records in GBIF. However, to analyze these kind of data most of the time it is necessary to transform the spatial distribution of species into a presence absence matrix or into a grid format. In this tutorial I will show how to easily make this transformation using the R package letsR, written by myself and Fabricio Villalobos.</description>
